User inputs the Date of travel, Destination and Place of Arrival to crawl all links of different Airlines from a single website like Makemytrip, to create a CSV file that contains data like Price of ticket, Ticket Timings, Layover places in the same table. Beautiful Soup and Selenium Libraries have been used to get the HTML code of the website and use apt methods to retrieve the desired data.  First we enter data like Arrival and Destination places and data and see the URL of the webpage changing and set a template for all combinations.
